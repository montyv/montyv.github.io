<p> My expertise is in applied mathematics, computer science, environmental management and engineering. </p>
<p> My research interests are in the general areas of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, model diagnostics, and cutting-edge computing (including high-performance cloud, quantum, edge). </p>
<p> I am the inventor and lead developer of a series of novel theoretical methods and computational tools for ML/AI. I am also a co-inventor of a series of patented ML/AI methodologies. </p>
<p> Over the years, I have been the principal investigator of numerous projects. These projects addressed various Earth-sciences problems, including geothermal, carbon sequestration/storage, oil/gas production, climate/anthropogenic impacts, wildfires, environmental management, water supply/contamination watershed hydrology, induced seismicity, and waste disposal. Work under these projects included various tasks such as ML, AI, data analytics, statistical analyses, model development, model analyses, uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analyses, risk assessment, and decision support. </p>
<p> Currently, I am running my own private business with Trais Kliphuis called <a href="https://envitrace.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EnviTrace LLC</a>. I am Co-Founter, CTO, and CSO at the company. We are developing Science-Informed AI/ML methods and software tools for environmental, climate, and energy problems. Special focus are geothermal and groundwater contamination problems. </p>

<p> My Ph.D. (University of Arizona, 2000) is in Hydrology and Water Resource Engineering with a minor in Applied Mathematics. My adviser was Regents Professor Shlomo P. Neuman.</p>
<p>I joined LANL in 2000. At LANL, I have been involved in numerous projects related to computational earth sciences, big-data analytics, modeling, model diagnostics, high-performance computing, quantum computing, and machine learning. I have authored book chapters and more than 130 research papers cited more than 3,000 times with h-index 30 (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sIFHVvwAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>). </p>
<p> For my research work, I received a series of awards. In 2019, I was inducted into the Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Innovation Society. </p>
<p> I am also the lead developer of a series of groundbreaking open-source codes for machine learning, data analytics, and model diagnostic. The codes are actively used worldwide by the community. They are available on <a href="https://github.com/montyvesselinov" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/monty" target="_blank">GitLab</a>. </p>
<p> One of the codes is <a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a>: a general framework for Unsupervised, Supervised, and Physics-Informed Machine ML/AI. In 2021, <a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> has received two <a href="https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-2021-winner" target="_blank">R&amp;D100 awards</a>. </p>
