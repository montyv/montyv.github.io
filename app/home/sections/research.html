The physical interpretation of the extracted features is done <em>a posteriori</em> by subject-matter experts.</p> <p>In contrast, supervised ML methods are trained based on large labeled datasets The labeling is performed <em>a priori</em> by subject-matter experts. The process of deep ML commonly includes both unsupervised and supervised techniques <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015</a> where unsupervised Machine Learning are applied to facilitate the process of data labeling.</p> <p>The integration of large datasets, powerful computational capabilities, and affordable data storage has resulted in the widespread use of ML/AI in science, technology, and industry.</p> <p>Recently, we have developed a novel unsupervised and physics-informed ML methods. The methods utilize Matrix/Tensor Decomposition (Factorization) coupled with physics, sparsity and nonnegativity constraints. The methods are capable to reveal the temporal and spatial footprints of the extracted features.</p> <h4>SmartTensors</h4> <p><a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> is a general framework for Unsupervised and Physics-Informed Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI).</p> <p><a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> incorporates a novel unsupervised ML based on tensor decomposition coupled with physics, sparsity and nonnegativity constraints.</p> <p><a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> has been applied to extract the temporal and spatial footprints of the features in multi-dimensional datasets in the form of multi-way arrays or tensors.</p> <p>The decomposition (factorization) of a given tensor \(X\) is typically performed by minimization of the Frobenius norm:</p> <p>$$ \frac{1}{2} ||X-G \otimes_1 A_1 \otimes_2 A_2 \dots \otimes_n A_n ||_F^2 $$ </p> <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(n\) is the dimensionality of the tensor \(X\)</li> <li>\(G\) is a "mixing" core tensor</li> <li>\(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\) are "feature” factors (in the form of vectors or matrices)</li> <li>\(\otimes\) is a tensor product applied to fold-in factors \(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\) in each of the tensor dimensions</li> </ul> <div> <img src="figures/tucker-paper.png" alt="tucker" height="320"> </div> <p>The product \(G \otimes_1 A_1 \otimes_2 A_2 \dots \otimes_n A_n\) is an estimate of \(X\) (\(X_{est}\)).</p> <p>The reconstruction error \(X - X_{est}\) is expected to be random uncorrelated noise.</p> <p>\(G\) is a \(n\)-dimensional tensor with a size and a rank lower than the size and the rank of \(X\). The size of tensor \(G\) defines the number of extracted features (signals) in each of the tensor dimensions.</p> <p>The factor matrices \(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\) represent the extracted features (signals) in each of the tensor dimensions. The number of matrix columns equals the number of features in the respective tensor dimensions (if there is only 1 column, the particular factor is a vector). The number of matrix rows in each factor (matrix) \(A_i\) equals the size of tensor X in the respective dimensions.</p> <p>The elements of tensor \(G\) define how the features along each dimension (\(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\)) are mixed to represent the original tensor \(X\).</p> <p>The tensor decomposition is commonly performed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_rank_decomposition">Candecomp/Parafac (CP)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_decomposition">Tucker</a> decomposition models.</p> <p>Some of the decomposition models can theoretically lead to unique solutions under specific, albeit rarely satisfied, noiseless conditions. When these conditions are not satisfied, additional minimization constraints can assist the factorization.</p> <p>A popular approach is to add sparsity and nonnegative constraints. Sparsity constraints on the elements of G reduce the number of features and their mixing (by having as many zero entries as possible). Nonnegativity enforces parts-based representation of the original data which also allows the tensor decomposition results for \(G\) and \(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\) to be easily interrelated <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KaxssMiWgswC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;ots=Lta2adM6LV&amp;sig=jNPDxjKlON1U3l46tZAYH92mvAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Cichocki et al, 2009</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> algorithms called <strong>NMFk</strong> and <strong>NTFk</strong> for Matrix/Tensor Factorization (Decomposition) coupled with sparsity and nonnegativity constraints custom k-means clustering has been developed in <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a></p> <p><a href="https://SmartTensors.com" target="_blank">SmartTensors</a> codes are available as open source on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/SmartTensors">GitHub</a>.</p> <div> <img src="logos/nmfk-logo.png" alt="nmfk logo" height="120"> <span> <img src="logos/ntfk-logo.png" alt="ntfk logo" height="120"> </span> </div> <div> <p> Other key methods/tools for ML include: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://github.com/madsjulia/RegAE.jl" target="_blank">RegAE.jl</a>: a novel curring-edge methodology for performing inverse analysis.
